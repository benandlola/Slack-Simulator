# Slack-Simulator

A chat-room akin to Slack using server and client code

To run the program you will want to use two terminals, one for the server and another for the client.
The server runs under the format `java Channel PortNumber` while the client uses `java ClientGUI`

Localhost is 127.0.0.1 in the client.
